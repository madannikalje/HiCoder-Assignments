            <span>What is web server?</span><br>
            <p>A web server is a computer that runs websites. It's a computer program that distributes web pages as they
                are requisitioned. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to
                the users.</p>

            <span>What is JavaScript?</span><br>
            <p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows
                you to make web pages interactive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <span>What is client-side JavaScript ?</span><br>
            <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser (Navigator or
                another web browser) and its Document Object Model (DOM). ... Server-side JavaScript extends the core
                language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <span>what is server side javascript ?</span><br>
            <p>Server Side JavaScript (SSJS) is an extended version of JavaScript that enables back-end access to
                databases, file systems, and servers. Server side javascript, is javascript code running over a server
                local resources , it's just like C# or Java, but the syntax is based on JavaScript.</p>

            <span>Difference between BOM and DOM in JavaScript ?</span><br>
            <p>The BOM (Browser Object Model) consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document
                which are children of window. In the document node is the DOM (Document Object Model), the document
                object model, which represents the contents of the page. You can manipulate it using javascript.</p>

            <span>What is a JavaScript engine ?</span><br>
            <p>A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines
                were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved
                performance.[1]

                JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a
                browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model.

                The use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers. For example, the V8 engine is a core component
                of the Node.js and Deno runtime systems.</p>

            <span>Compare Static Sites and Dynamic Sites</span><br>
            <p>static Website pages are those with content that cannot change without a developer editing its source
                code, while dynamic Website pages can display different content from the same source code.</p>
