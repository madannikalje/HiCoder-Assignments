            <span>What is variable scope in JavaScript?</span><br>
            <p> Variable Scope. Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the
                accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global: Global variables
                are those declared outside of a block. Local variables are those declared inside of a block.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <span>What is global scope of a variable?</span><br>
            <p>In computer programming, a global variable is a variable with global scope, meaning that it is visible
                (hence accessible) throughout the program, unless shadowed. The set of all global variables is known as
                the global environment or global state.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <span>What is local scope of a variable?</span><br>
            <p>The scope of a variable is the region of a program in which the variable is visible, i.e., in which it is
                accessible by its name and can be used. In Java, the scope of a local variable is the body of the method
                in which it is declared.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block" id="f">
            <span>What is the main differences between let and var?
            </span><br>
            <p>The main difference between let and var is that scope of a variable defined with let is limited to the
                block in which it is declared while variable declared with var has the global scope. So we can say that
                var is rather a keyword which defines a variable globally regardless of block scope.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <span>What is scope chain?
            </span><br>
            <p>The scope chain is simply the memory space of the function that was called, and the memory space of its
                outer environment.</p>

        <div class="block">
            <span>What is global variable leaks?</span><br>
            <p>"Leaking" into global scope is when something used in a local scope is unintentionally made available to
                the global scope. That means assigning to a variable not already defined in the current scope.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <span>What is memory leaks?
            </span><br>
            <p>a memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory
                allocations[1] in a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released. A memory leak may also
                happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code.[2] A memory leak
                has symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer
                with access to the program's source code.</p>

        <div class="block">
            <span>What is use strict in JavaScript?</span><br>
            <p>JavaScript's strict mode, introduced in ECMAScript 5, is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of
                JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "sloppy mode". Strict mode isn't just a subset: it
                intentionally has different semantics from normal code.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <span>What is the difference between undefined and undeclared variable?</span><br>
            <p>undeclared:
                A variable is undeclared if it has not been declared with an appropriate keyword (i.e. var, let or
                const). Accessing an undeclared variable will throw a ReferenceError. <br>
                undefined:
                A variable is undefined if it hasn't been assigned a value. undefined is a primitive data type in
                JavaScript and represents the absence of a value, intentional or otherwise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <span>What is hoisting in JavaScript?</span><br>
            <p>In JavaScript, Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope
                before code execution. Basically, it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables
                are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or
                local.</p>

        <div class="block">
            <span>What is the difference between DOM and BOM?</span><br>
            <p>DOM : The document object represents the whole html document. When html document is loaded in the
                browser, it becomes a document object. <br>
                BOM : The window object represents a window in browser. An object of window is created automatically by
                the browser.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <span>What is nodeType, nodeName and nodeValue in JavaScript?</span><br>
            <p>nodeType: The nodeType property returns the node type, as a number, of the specified node. <br>
                nodeName: The nodeName property returns the name of the specified node. <br>
                nodeValue: The nodeValue property sets or returns the node value of the specified node.
